<h2>Milk Chocolates</h2>
<p>Milk chocolate is solid chocolate made with milk added in the form of milk powder, liquid milk, or condensed milk. In 1875, Swiss confectioner Daniel Peter, in cooperation with his neighbour Henri Nestlé in Vevey, developed the first solid milk chocolate using condensed milk. The bar was named "Gala Peter", combining the Greek word for "milk" and his name.

<h2>Baking chocolate/ Unsweetened chocolate</h2>
<p>Unsweetened chocolate, also known as bitter, baking chocolate, or cooking chocolate, is pure chocolate liquor mixed with some form of fat to produce a solid substance. The pure, ground, roasted cocoa beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. With the addition of sugar, however, it is used as the base for cakes, brownies, confections, and cookies.</p><br>
<h5>Best use of it</h5>
<p>unsweetened chocolates are used for making cakes cookies and other such stuff!</p>

<h2>Dark chocolate</h2>
<p>also known as "plain chocolate" or "black chocolate", is produced using higher percentages of cocoa, traditionally with cocoa butter instead of milk, but there are also dark milk chocolates and many degrees of hybrids. Dark chocolate can be eaten as is, or used in cooking, for which thicker, baking bars, usually with high cocoa percentages ranging from 70% to 100% are sold.
Semisweet and Bittersweet are US terms for dark chocolate. In the United States, both must contain a minimum of 35% cocoa solids. Typically, bittersweet chocolate has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable when baking. Many brands now print on the package the percentage of cocoa in the chocolate (as chocolate liquor and added cocoa butter). The higher the percentage of cocoa, the less sweet the chocolate is.</p>
<h5>Best Dark chocolates</h5>
<p>
"Couverture chocolate" is a high-quality class of dark chocolate, rich in cocoa butter and precisely tempered. Couverture chocolate is used by professionals for dipping, coating, molding and garnishing ('couverture' means 'covering' in French). Popular brands of couverture chocolate used by pastry chefs and often sold in gourmet and specialty food stores include: Valrhona, Felchlin, Lindt & Sprüngli, Scharffen Berger, Cacao Barry, Callebaut, Chocodate, Chocofig fuel chocolates, and Guittard. These chocolates contain a high percentage of cocoa.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2>White chocolate</h2>
<p>White chocolate is made of sugar, milk, and cocoa butter, without the cocoa solids cocoa powder
is used for baking, and for drinking with added milk and sugar. There are two types of unsweetened cocoa powder: natural cocoa (like the sort produced by the Broma process), and Dutch-process cocoa. Both are made by pulverizing partially defatted chocolate liquor and removing nearly all the cocoa butter; Dutch-process cocoa is additionally processed with alkali to neutralize its natural acidity. Natural cocoa is light in colour and somewhat acidic with a strong chocolate flavor. Natural cocoa is commonly used in recipes that also use baking soda; as baking soda is an alkali, combining it with natural cocoa creates a leavening action that allows the batter to rise during baking. Dutch cocoa is slightly milder in taste, with a deeper and warmer colour than natural cocoa. Dutch-process cocoa is frequently used for chocolate drinks such as hot chocolate due to its ease in blending with liquids. However, Dutch processing destroys most of the flavonoids present in cocoa.</p>

 <p>In 2005, Hershey discontinued their pure Dutch-process European Style cocoa and replaced it with Special Dark, a blend of natural and Dutch-process cocoa.
