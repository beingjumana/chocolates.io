<p>Milk chocolate is solid chocolate made with milk added in the form of milk powder, liquid milk, or condensed milk. In 1875, Swiss confectioner Daniel Peter, in cooperation with his neighbour Henri Nestl√© in Vevey, developed the first solid milk chocolate using condensed milk. The bar was named "Gala Peter", combining the Greek word for "milk" and his name.
